A general overview", " Session 4 Finding and Obtaining Environmental Data for Conservation Types of environmental data: direcly observed (satellite data) Interpolated or modeled etc. Discussion of CRSs. 4.1 Environmental Layers. A general overview This section provides a brief narrative of Marius Someveille’s PowerPoint presentation. We are trying to succinctly capture the main points in this web/bookdown version so that it might easily be translated with Google Translate. Environmental layers in this context are raster data they carry information about particular “cells” or “pixels” of the earth’s surface. All of these terms will be defined in detail later. For now, here are a few pictures of what environmental layers might look like when they are plotted and displayed: 4.1.1 Environmental layers in conservation genetics 4.1.1.1 Landscape connectivity analysis (gene flow) Connectivity is essential for long term persistence of populations and metapopulations as it affects gene flow. Functional connectivity is the degree to which individuals move through a landscape, which is affected by landscape features and environmental heterogeneity. Landscape genetics tests which landscape and environmental factors best explain genetic connectivity among populations and highlights which landscape features need to be maintained or enhanced to facilitate connectivity (gene flow) for different species. For example, Robertson et al. (2018) studied frogs in multiple locations in North America, shown here: The positions of samples are shown here on a map that was created from land cover data. However, many other layers area available, giving information of, for example, topography, temperature, and moisture levels in the different locations. Landscape genetics approaches were used to identify which of these features were most associated with connectivity between populations in each of the different regions (i.e, different colors on the map). They summarized those results as follows: 4.1.1.2 Environmental Niche Analysis Ruegg et al. (2021) shows another example of the use of environmental layers in conservation genetics. In this case, genetic differences resolved separate breeding populations of the willow flycatcher in North America, and also made it possible to identify where birds from each breeding population spend their winters, as shown in the following figure (in which the different breeding populations are denoted by different colors): With the breeding and wintering areas for each subpopulation identified, other environmental layers (not shown) were used to identify the environmental and climatic conditions that defined the birds breeding and wintering niches for the subpopulations. Population trends were found to be associated with overlap between breeding and wintering niches, with the subpopulation showing the least niche overlap being the only subpopulation not showing a decreasing trend. 4.1.1.3 Genome-environment association to study vulnerability Associations between genetic variation and environmental variation (that we will hear about from Christen Bossu!) can be used to identify places where there is expected to be a mismatch between expected genetic patterns and environmental conditions after changes due to climate change. One of the first papers documenting this was Bay et al. (2018). In their study, a variety of environmental predictors (BIO18, BIO15, etc.), whose values across space are represented by environmental layer data, were found to be associated with genetic variation, as shown in the following montage of figures from the paper: 4.1.2 Environmental layers as raster data 4.1.3 Coordinate system and projections 4.1.4 Parameters of raster data 4.1.5 Examples of climate layers Source Method Variables Extent Spatial resolution Temporal resolution WorldClim Interpolation of observations from weather stations Temperature Precipitation Solar radiation BIOCLIM Global 30 sec (~1km2) 2.5 min 5 min 10 min (~340 km2) Monthly 1970 – 2000 Chelsa Quasi-mechanistical downscale of global circulation model Temperature Precipitation BIOCLIM Global 30 arc sec (~1km2) Monthly 1979 – 2018 Prism Statistical model using weather station data and atmospheric process Temperature Precipitation USA 30 arc sec (~1km2) Monthly 1981–2010 4.1.6 Examples of atmospheric layers Source Method Variables Extent Spatial resolution Temporal resolution NOAA Global Forecast System Global atmospheric model Wind direction Wind speed Global 0.5 deg 6 times / day 2011 – present WorldClim Interpolation of observations from weather stations Wind speed Water vapor pressure Global 30 sec (~1km2) 2.5 min 5 min 10 min (~340 km2) Monthly 1970 – 2000 4.1.7 Examples of vegetation layers Source Method Variables Extent Spatial resolution Temporal resolution VIP30 (NASA) Remote sensing using spectrometer on board satellites NDVI EVI Global 0.05 deg ~5.6km Monthly 1981 – 2014 Copernicus (ESA) Remote sensing using spectrometer on board satellites NDVI EVI Global 300m 10-day Present GEDI (NASA) Remote sensing using lidar (laser ranging) onboard the ISS Vertical profile of vegetation: canopy height, canopy vertical structure, ground elevation 51.6 deg N and S latitudes 25m Annual Present 4.1.8 Examples of landscape layers Source Method Variables Extent Spatial resolution Temporal resolution SRTM (NASA) Remote sensing using radar onboard satellites Elevation Global 1 arc-second (~30m) NA MODIS (NASA) Remote sensing using spectrometer onboard satellites Snow cover Global 30 arc-sec (~1km2) Copernicus (ESA) remote sensing + random forest for classification Land cover Global 100m NA NASA Gridded Population of the World Input data are census tables Human population density Global 30 arc-sec (~1km2) NA 2000–2020 References Bay RA, Harrigan RJ, Le Underwood V et al.

We will do an example that involves the Yucatan Jay (or, better yet, ask Richard if a more interesting/iconic species is available). ECA has downloaded occurrences from GBIF (3 Mb compressed) and has put them into data. We can use that and some of the raster data and some vector data to do a little exploration of how to use the sf package in combination with ggplot2. Also, some filtering in the tidyverse. Ideas: Do some filtering of the data set (tidyverse reprise) Talk about lubridate for dealing with dates and times facet wrap over months to look at occurrences, etc. Some very light geometrical operations, for example get all the observations within X km of some features (like highways). Explore the use of different raster backgrounds. "],["conclude.html", "Session 6 Concluding Remarks / Parting Words", " Session 6 Concluding Remarks / Parting Words Something here.
