## Setting up your computer

This course covers topics in landscape genetics/genomics, and relies
heavily on the R programming language.  In order to follow
along with the code and be successful in running all of the
examples, it is imperative to have very recent versions of
R and RStudio, and updated versions of a number of packages.  

The following is a description of the software needed to engage in the
course.  This setup was tested on a Mac running Mojave 10.14.6, but
should also work on most other Mac or Windows operating systems.

If you are running Linux, there will be some external dependencies to install
(such as the GEOS library), that are actually wrapped up in the binary
versions of packages 'terra' and 'sf' on CRAN for Mac and Windows.

### Step 1. Get the latest versions of R and RStudio

* First, install the latest version of R.  Go to 
[https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) and follow the appropriate
link to _Download and Install_, depending on your operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows).
    - For Mac, you can download `R-4.1.2.pkg` and install.
    - For Windows, first go into the `base` directory and Download R 4.1.2, and install it. **THEN**, go back to "R for Window" page where you clicked into
    `base`, and download and install the `Rtools` as well.   The latter gives you
    tools for building packages, which is required for a few packages we use.

* Download and install the latest stable version of RStudio for
your operating system.  Go to 
[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and choose the big blue download button for "RStudio Desktop, Open 
Source License, **Free**", then hit the download button on the next page and
follow instructions to install RStudio.

### Step 2. Install a number of R packages that are relatively easy to install

Our work will require a number of packages that can be found in binary
form on CRAN.  As such, installing them is typically not to arduous.

I have found that sometimes, when requesting the installation of a large number
of packages, there can be the occasional problem.  Sometimes, an error message
tells you which package (often a dependency) failed to install.  If that is
the case, try to install the failed package by itself with the `install.packages()`, 
function, directly, and then re-run the `install.packages()` command that
originally failed.

Here are the packages that we load in the Rmds:
```
"RColorBrewer",
"bookdown", # this will get knitr and rmarkdown, I do believe
"broom",
"data.table",
"ggrepel",
"ggspatial",
"googledrive",
"googlesheets4",
"gradientForest",
"gstat",
"modelr",
"raster",
"rasterVis",
"rgdal",
"sf",
"terra",
"tidyverse",
"viridis", # preferred color palette for graphing
```

We also have a few extra ones from namespace addressing:
```
"kableExtra",
"geodata",
"rnaturalearth",
"cowplot",
"knitr",
```

That is not too many.
