## Setting up your computer

This course covers topics in landscape genetics/genomics, and relies
heavily on the R programming language.  In order to follow
along with the code and be successful in running all of the
examples, it is imperative to have very recent versions of
R and RStudio, and updated versions of a number of packages.  

The following is a description of the software needed to engage in the
course.  This setup was tested on a Mac running Mojave 10.14.6, but
should also work on most other Mac or Windows operating systems.

If you are running Linux, there will be some external dependencies to install
(such as the GEOS library), that are actually wrapped up in the binary
versions of packages 'terra' and 'sf' on CRAN for Mac and Windows.

### Step 1. Get the latest versions of R and RStudio

* First, install the latest version of R.  Go to 
[https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) and follow the appropriate
link to _Download and Install_, depending on your operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows).
    - For Mac, you can download `R-4.1.2.pkg` and install.
    - For Windows, first go into the `base` directory and Download R 4.1.2, and install it. **THEN**, go back to "R for Window" page where you clicked into
    `base`, and download and install the `Rtools` as well.   The latter gives you
    tools for building packages, which is required for a few packages we use.

* Download and install the latest stable version of RStudio for
your operating system.  Go to 
[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and choose the big blue download button for "RStudio Desktop, Open 
Source License, **Free**", then hit the download button on the next page and
follow instructions to install RStudio.

### Step 2. Install a number of R packages that are relatively easy to install

Our work will require a number of packages that can be found in binary
form on CRAN.  As such, installing them is typically not to arduous.

Sometimes, when installing packages, you may get a message telling you that
a later version of the package you want is available in source form than in
binary form.  Typically, it is still easiest, fastest, and usually reliable,
to just use the binary form.  So, after R gives you such a message,
if you see R asking a question like:
```
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```
Usually the appropriate answer is to type `no` into the console, and hit return.


I have found that sometimes, when requesting the installation of a large number
of packages, there can be the occasional problem.  Sometimes, an error message
tells you which package (often a dependency) failed to install.  If that is
the case, try to install the failed package by itself with the `install.packages()`, 
function, directly, and then re-run the `install.packages()` command that
originally failed.

You can install packages in a few rounds of different types.  Note that I tend to
use the RStudio CRAN mirror.

#### RMarkdown related packages

To build the entire bookdown project of notes we need the 'bookdown' package
and some other related package. Installing
these also installs a bunch of other things that are essential for using
RMarkdown.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  c(
    "knitr",
    "rmarkdown",
    "bookdown",
    "kableExtra" # for making nice tables in Rmarkdown
  ),
  repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com"
)
```


#### Tidyverse related packages

The next big slug of packages to install are the tidyverse packages,
and a few other related ones.
Typically this can be done by just installing 'tidyverse' itself, and
then a few more that we need.  If you already have the core packages of the
tidyverse, (see [this section](#what-tidyverse)), you might need to reinstall
these to ensure you have the latest versions.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  c(
    "tidyverse",
    "broom",
    "modelr",
    "googledrive",
    "googlesheets4",
    "ggrepel",      # for fitting labels in space into ggplots
    "cowplot",      # for arranging ggplots together
    "RColorBrewer", # a color palette for graphing
    "viridis",      # a color palette for graphing
    "data.table"    # not really a tidyverse package, but
                    # useful for many things.
  ),
  repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com"
)
```


#### Geospatial-related packages

The last collection of packages to install are a few geospatial
packages for handling raster and vector spatial data.  A few of these,
like 'sf' and 'terra',
are large packages because they include all the underlying libraries
for geometric computations, etc.  This means that, as long as you get the binary versions
from CRAN, for Mac and Windows, you don't have to bother
with installing all those external library dependencies.  If you are using
Linux, or you try to install 'terra' or 'sf' from GitHub, then dealing with
all those dependencies becomes a much bigger headache.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  c(
    "terra",
    "sf",
    "raster", # this has been largely replaced by terra, but we still use
              # it in some code.
    "rasterVis",
    "gstat",
    "rgdal",  # this may eventually be phased out...
    "ggspatial", # for plotting RGB rasters in ggplot, efficiently, among other things
    "geodata",   # for easy fetching of environmental layers
    "rnaturalearth",  # for easy fetching of Natural Earth data
    "rnaturalearthdata"
  ),
  repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com"
)
```

#### The 'gradientForest' package

Now, we come to a somewhat harder package to install, because it requires
some compilation.  We use these packages for the gradient random forest
analysis on the last day. 'gradientForest' requires the dependancy 'extendedForest', an R package for
classification and regression based on forest trees using random inputs. 

Both of these packages require compilation, it seems.  With the newest version of R, 'extendedForest' is installed automatically as a dependency.

To compile packages might require a little more configuration, etc.

**If you are using a Mac** 

You should be running R 4.0.0 or above.  In that case, 
to build packages, you need the XCode Command line tools.  If you don't already
have these, then you should install them.  Doing so requires administrator access
on your computer. Open the "Terminal" app and type:
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
into the command line.  When asked for your password, provide it.  Then click to agree
on the software license agreement, and finally click the blue "install" button that comes
up on the other screen.

Then, you also need to get the gFortran compiler for Mac.  Information about this
can be found by going to [https://mac.r-project.org/tools/](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/).
Find the link (inside the yellow boxes) for your appropriate type of mac (intel or ARM64), and
download the appropriate installer for the gFortran compiler. Then install it.  In my case, since
I have an Intel Mac, I downloaded, `gfortran-8.2-Mojave.dmg`.  To install it, you have to
double click it and then go inside the folder that creates, to find the `gfortran.pkg`, which
you can double click to launch the installer.  Install it to the default location.

On my Mac running Mojave (10.14.6) I got errors when trying to compile this package.  It
was unable to find the C 'stdlib.h' header file.  So, I ended up also having to do this:
```{sh, eval=FALSE}
sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /
```

If you have compilation problems on your Mac you might try something similar. But you might have
to name the headers for your own system.  perhaps by tab completing on:
```sh
sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10
```


** If you have a Windows computer **

We haven't tested it, but you should be just fine so long as you
installed the `Rtools` as described above.


** Finally, if you have set up your system on Mac or Windows, install the packages **

The package we need is not on CRAN.  Rather, it is on the R-forge repository.

In this case, we might be asked:
```
Package which is only available in source form, and may need compilation of
  C/C++/Fortran: ‘extendedForest’
Do you want to attempt to install these from sources? (Yes/no/cancel)
```
And, for this one, we need to respond, `Yes`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("gradientForest", repos="https://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```

If all goes well, this should compile for you.
