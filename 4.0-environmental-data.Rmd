- Interpolated or modeled etc.

## Environmental Layers. A general overview

This section provides a brief narrative of Marius Someveille's
PowerPoint presentation.  We are trying to succinctly capture the
main points in this web/bookdown version so that it might easily
be translated with Google Translate.

Environmental layers in this context are _raster_ data they carry
information about particular "cells" or "pixels" of the earth's surface.
All of these terms will be defined in detail later. For now, here are a few
pictures of what environmental layers might look like when they are plotted
and displayed:

### Environmental layers in conservation genetics

#### Landscape connectivity analysis (gene flow)

Connectivity is essential for long term persistence of populations and metapopulations as it affects gene flow. Functional connectivity is the degree to which individuals move through a landscape, which is affected by landscape features and environmental heterogeneity. Landscape genetics tests which landscape and environmental factors best explain genetic connectivity among populations and highlights which landscape features need to be maintained or enhanced to facilitate connectivity (gene flow) for different species. 

For example, @robertson2018regional studied frogs in multiple locations in
North America, shown here:
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/env_layers/robertson-land-cover.png")
``` 
  
The positions of samples are shown here on a map that was created from
land cover data.  However, many other layers area available, giving information
of, for example, topography, temperature, and moisture levels in the different
locations.  Landscape genetics approaches were used to identify which of these 
features were most associated with connectivity between populations in
each of the different regions (i.e, different colors on the map).  They summarized
those results as follows:
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/env_layers/robertson-table.png")
``` 
  
  
#### Environmental Niche Analysis

@ruegg2021linking shows another example of the use of environmental layers
in conservation genetics.  In this case, genetic differences resolved separate
breeding populations of the willow flycatcher in North America, and also made it
possible to identify where birds from each breeding population spend their
winters, as shown in the following figure (in which the different breeding
populations are denoted by different colors):
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/env_layers/wifl-map.png")
``` 

With the breeding and wintering areas for each subpopulation identified,
other environmental layers (not shown) were used to identify the environmental
and climatic conditions that defined the birds breeding and wintering
_niches_ for the subpopulations. Population trends were found to be associated
with overlap between breeding and wintering niches, with the subpopulation showing 
the least niche overlap being the only subpopulation not showing a decreasing trend.
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/env_layers/wifl-niches.png")
``` 


#### Genome-environment association to study vulnerability

Associations between genetic variation and environmental variation
(that we will hear about from Christen Bossu!) can be used to identify
places where there is expected to be a mismatch between expected genetic patterns
and environmental conditions after changes due to climate change.  One of the first
papers documenting this was @bay2018genomic.  

In their study, a variety of environmental predictors (BIO18, BIO15, etc.), whose
values across space are represented by environmental layer data, were found to
be associated with genetic variation, as shown in the following montage of
figures from the paper:
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}

```
