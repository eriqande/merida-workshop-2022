#  Handling and Visualizing Spatial Data in R {#spatdata}

Stuff here.

Marius and I brainstormed on this.  We will do an example
that involved the Yucatan Jay.  ECA has downloaded
occurrences from GBIF (3 Mb compressed) and has put them
into `data`.

We can use that and some of the raster data and some
vector data to do a little exploration of how to use the
`sf` package in combination with ggplot2.

Also, some filtering in the tidyverse.

Ideas:

- Do some filtering of the data set (tidyverse reprise)
- Talk about lubridate for dealing with dates and times
- facet wrap over months to look at occurrences, etc.
- Some very light geometrical operations, for example get all the
observations within X km of some features (like highways).
- Explore the use of different raster backgrounds.
