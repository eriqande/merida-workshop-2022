# Basic Introduction to R and *ggplot2*

This is an introduction to R and *ggplot2* that was created specificially for the UCMexus Conservation Genomics Workshop 2022.  The data used in this tutorial is a typical dataset used in ggplot.

## RStudio Layout

The RStudio layout is broken up into four panes: **Source**, **Console**, **Environment (history/connections)** and **Files (plots/packages/etc)**.  Within these panes there are additional tabs and we will go over the most important ones.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2.0_R_ggplot/RStudio.png")
```

The **Source** pane is where you can read, edit, and run your R code and the code can be saved as a *.R* file indicating it is an R script document, or *.Rmd* file indicating it is an R markdown file with the code split into code chunks that you'll see throughout this tutorial. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2.0_R_ggplot/Source.png")
```


An R document is written as a normal text document, however each line is a line of code in R.  However if you highlight a line and click **Run** (or type command-return), then the line of code will be executed and this activity will be displayed in the **Console**.

The **Console** pane is where the R code is executed and results are displayed, as well as other messages and warnings.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2.0_R_ggplot/Console.png")
```
  
  
The **Environment** pane lists all available data and variables in the current session.  For example, in the example **Source** pane above I have a line of code `another_variable <- 5` which sets the string `another_variable` to represent the value 5.  After executing this line of code, the variable is stored and can be called at any point.  Once a variable has been created, it will be displayed in the **Environment**.  

```{r}
another_variable<-5

another_variable

another_variable*5
```


*Note*: Whenever opening a script into a new session of R, you will need to re-run the lines of code you wish to use.  Opening a .R script does not automatically run the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2.0_R_ggplot/Environment.png")
```

The **Files** pane is used to navigate through directories and can be used to open files directly into RStudio.  This will be useful when importing data into R.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2.0_R_ggplot/Files.png")
```

Next to the **Files** tab, there is **Plots**.  In the example **Source** pane above I created a plot with the following code (*note*: the function `ggplot()` and the `mpg` dataset are from the `ggplot2` package that comes in the `tidyverse` package. You need to have `tidyverse` installed and loaded for this code to work on your console. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

p <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
        geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
p
```
  
When the code is executed, the resulting scatterplot is displayed below. If this was run in a R script rather than an Rmarkdown, the plot would be displayed in the *Plots* window on the left.

Also useful is the **Help** tab for understanding what a function does.
    
## Data visualization with ggplot2
  
1. We want to understand our data and our analysis.
2. We want to produce graphics for publication and presentation.
    a. We want to create plots quickly and get many things “for free”.
    b. We want many options to customize and make things look awesome.

### Understanding the Ggplot Syntax

*ggplot2* uses the basic units of the “grammar of graphics” (Leland Wilkinson) to construct data visualizations in a layered approach.

The basic units in the “grammar of graphics” consist of:

*  The data or the actual information that is to be visualized.
*  The geometries, shortened to “geoms”, which describe the shapes that represent the data. These shapes can be dots on a scatter plot, bar charts on the graph, or a line to plot the data. Data are mapped to geoms.
*  The aesthetics, or the visual attributes of the plot, including the scales on the axes, the color, the fill, and other attributes concerning appearance

The syntax for constructing ggplots could be puzzling if you are a beginner or work primarily with base graphics. The main difference is that, unlike base graphics, ggplot works with dataframes and not individual vectors. All the data needed to make the plot is typically be contained within the dataframe supplied to the ggplot() itself or can be supplied to respective geoms. More on that later.

#### A plot consists of components
The second noticeable feature is that you can keep enhancing the plot by adding more layers (and themes) to an existing plot created using the ggplot() function
  
Here is a verbose definition of a simple plot. Note, this is not something you will see/use. But it's a nice way to break down the components

Ok, let's dive into this very long code to create a simple plot. Note there are 5 components in this code chunk.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  layer(data = mtcars, #1
      mapping = aes(x = hp, y = qsec), #2
      geom = 'point', #3
      stat = 'identity', #4
      position = 'identity') + #5
  theme_bw()+
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

**1: Data**

> __layer(data = mtcars, #1__ 
  

* A data layer needs data to display.
* Data is a data.frame or tibble if you are using tidyverse

Let's look at the top of a data set used by tidyverse 
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

**2: What is a mapping?**

>  layer(data = mtcars, #1 

>  __mapping = aes(x = hp, y = qsec), #2__ 

*  An aesthetic mapping connects your data to your plot. (e.g. x, y, color, shape, alpha, size, linetype, etc.).
*  Aesthetics are “things that we can perceive on the graphic”.
*  We use the aes() function to create this mapping.
*  aes(aesthetic = variable).

For the code chunk below, we would be mapping hp on the x-axis and qsec on the y-axis.

```
aes(x = hp, y = qsec)
```
 
**3: What is a geom?**

> layer(data = mtcars, #1 
 
> mapping = aes(x = hp, y = qsec), #2
 
> __geom = 'point', #3__

Simply the geometrical shape that you want to do draw.
 
*  0d: point, text,
*  1d: path, line (ordered path),
*  2d: polygon, interval, boxplot etc.
*  geoms translate the aesthetics into an actual plot.

Geoms determine what aesthetics you need, and which you can use! (e.g. points cannot display the linetype aesthetic.)
  
Which aesthetics you need/can use is usually obvious, but is also clearly documented.
  
**Simplifying the code**
Instead of writing out the whole layer(), we can use geom_*() functions to create the layer for us. These functions use common defaults.

We simply write:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hp, y = qsec), data = mtcars) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
  
Or, using positional matching:
 
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(hp, qsec), mtcars) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
 
Like geom_point(), there are many such geom layers which we will see in a subsequent part in this tutorial series. Let's add details to this plot in the form of additional ashthetics.

__How would you change color of the points to the cyl variable?__
```{r}
ggplot() +
geom_point(aes(hp, qsec, color = cyl), mtcars) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

**Continious versus discrete variables**
R treats continuous and discrete information differently. ggplot directly uses the class of the variable to figure out how to best display data.

In this case, it checks:
```{r}
class(mtcars$cyl)
```

For it to recognized as a category (with fitting colors) we need a factor:
```{r}
class(factor(mtcars$cyl))
```

Character strings are silently converted to factors:
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(hp, qsec, color = as.character(cyl)), mtcars) +
  labs(color = 'cyl') + 
  theme_bw() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

*  Some more on stats.
*  Scales.
*  Coordinate systems (brief).
*  Facets.
*  Plotting model fits.
*  Some more challenges.

### A special stat: stat_smooth
We can keep adding additional layers to this plot to make it more informative. One thing that is often useful when you're looking at data on a scatter plot is a visual representation of how closely the variable on the x axis and the variable on the y axis are related to each other, and the strength of that relationship. We can summarize this using a fitted line.

In ggplot, we can automatically add a fitted line using the layer *geom_smooth()*. By default, *geom_smooth()* will show the relationship between the x and y variables using locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (also known as LOESS) rather than by drawing a straight line. If we want a single straight line to summarize our data, we need to specify that we want *geom_smooth()* to fit a linear model (or "lm").

```{r}
g<-ggplot(mtcars,aes(hp, qsec)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
g
```
 
**Exercise 1: Create the following plot**
 
Now, how would you change the code above to change the color of the point layer, withuot affecting the smooth layer since the aes() aesthetic mapping is passed at the point layer.
  
```{r,echo=F}
g <- ggplot(mtcars,aes(hp, qsec, color = as.character(cyl)) ) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = TRUE, color="black") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
g
```
Note, the code above would only change the color of the point layer, it would not affect the color of the smooth layer since the aes() aesthetic mapping is passed at the point layer.

**Exercise 2: Create the following plot**

Can you recreate this plot using other aesthetic options?

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(hp, 
                 qsec, 
                 shape = factor(vs), 
                 size = mpg), 
             mtcars, 
             alpha = 0.5, 
             col = 'red') +
  labs(shape = 'vs', size = 'qsec') +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

**Exercise 3: Create the following plot**

How about if we wanted to create a line plot with this data? How would you create the following plot create separate lines based on the "am" variable.
 
```{r,echo = F}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(hp, qsec,lty = factor(am)), mtcars) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
 
#### Shared data and mapping
Now what if we want to add labels. Let's look at another dataset and think about this- now we have multiple layers. You might've noticed this with the geom_smooth function too.

*  When multiple layers share the same data or mapping you can define it inside of ggplot.
*  Everything in ggplot will be used by default for all layers.
*  Use data inside a layer in order to not use the default.
*  Set or map an aesthetic to not use the default. You can map to NULL.
*  This goes for each aesthetic individually! Not for the entire mapping.

In many cases I provide the data and mapping in ggplot.
```{r}
g <- ggplot(msleep,
          aes(sleep_total, 
              log(brainwt), 
              label = name, #make sure to add the label aes!
              col=vore)) 
    
g + geom_point() + # then add a layer of points 
    geom_text(size=3) # and then add labels to the points
```
 
But this plot is a bit busy and messy. Let's move around the names to make this more readable (less overlap)! Let's also fix the axes names.
 
```{r}
 g + #the ggplot object you created above that you can add layers to
    geom_point() + # then add a layer of points 
    geom_text(check_overlap = T,# automatically reduce overlap (deletes some labels)
              vjust = "bottom", # adjust the vertical orientation
              nudge_y = 0.1, # move the text up a bit so it doesn't touch the points
              angle = 30,# tilt the text 30 degrees
              size = 2) + # make the text smaller (to reduce overlap more)
   labs(title = "Sleeping habits of mammals given their brain weight", # plot title
         x = "Sleep Total", # x axis label
         y = "log(brain weight)" # y axis label
        )
```

 Note above, there are some points without labels. Here's another way to add labels to your plot with ggrepel. 

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
g +
    geom_point() + # then add a layer of points 
    geom_text_repel(vjust = "bottom", # adjust the vertical orientation
              nudge_y = 0.1, # move the text up a bit so it doesn't touch the points
              angle = 30,# tilt the text 30 degrees
              size = 2) + # make the text smaller (to reduce overlap more)
   labs(title = "Sleeping habits of mammals given their brain weight", # plot title
         x = "Sleep Total", # x axis label
         y = "log(brain weight)" # y axis label
        )
```

Let's move onto the other components of the ggplot syntax. 

**4. What is a stat?**

> layer(data = mtcars, #1  

> mapping = aes(x = hp, y = qsec), #2 
 
> geom = 'point', #3 
 
> __stat = 'identity', #4__ 

Often, you don’t want to directly plot the actual data, but rather some transformation of the data.

__stats__ perform all kinds of data transformations.

The most common transformations: 
*  binning (StatBin). 
*  counting (StatCount). 
*  summing (StatSum).
*  averaging (StatSummary).
*  smoothing (StatSmooth).
*  boxplots (StatBoxplot).
*  densities (StatDensity).
*  nothing (StatIdentity).

*Note* geom_* functions have default stats.
E.g. ?geom_boxplot shows stat = "boxplot".

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(factor(cyl), hp, fill=factor(cyl)), mtcars) +
  xlab('Cylinder') +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

**Exercise 4a-c: One variable exercises**

How would you create the following plots? I want you to use a new eBird dataset, however, the syntax still applies. 

```{r}
myebird<-read_csv("data/2.0a/MyEBirdData_tidy.csv")
```
Let's take a quick look at this new data set. It has counts of several bird species in Colorado, and the locations and dates of these observations. 

```{r}
head(myebird)
```
In order to create the next plots, we may need to *tidy* some of the data. While, the module concurrently being run by Richard goes into how to use *tidyverse* in more depth, this section will provide a *small* hint of what *tidying* data can mean and how we can pipe (%>%) this directly into the  *ggplot()* command.

With a smaller version of the dataset, we are going to create histograms and density plots with some eBird data specific from Colorado. Histograms are a way to show variation in data and are plotted on a single numeric value. In this case we will just look at the Count column of the data frame. This is plotted on the x-axis and to avoid confusion I change the name of the x-axis since the y-axis is the counts of each value.

To make things more interpretable for you as new R users, I am now breaking up the data tidying you can do in Richard's tidyverse section and assigning that to a variable, then using that tidied data frame variable in the *ggplot()* function for plotting (again we could pipe into ggplot but that might not be so clear at this point). Remember from our previous examples that *ggplot()* uses "+" not the pipe function to add more commands/functions.

```{r}
myebird2 <- myebird %>%
  filter(CommonName %in% c("Canada Goose"))

myebird3 <- myebird %>%
  filter(CommonName %in% c("Canada Goose","American Robin"))
```

a) First plot. A simple histogram of counts for the Canada Goose, and we use the stats binning. 
 
```{r, echo=F}
ggplot(myebird2) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Count), bins = 100) +
  xlab("Number of individuals seen per observation") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Canadian Goose observations")
```
 
 b) Second plot. How would you change the color of the histogram?
 
```{r, echo=F}
ggplot(myebird2,aes(Count)) +
  stat_bin(bins = 50, col="black",fill="pink") +
  xlab("Number of individuals seen per observation") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Canada Goose observations")
```

c) Third plot is a stat = density plot, for counts of two bird species.

```{r, echo=F}
ggplot(myebird3, aes(Count, col = factor(CommonName))) +
  stat_density(fill = NA)
```

**5. What is a position?**
> layer(data = mtcars, #1 

> mapping = aes(x = hp, y = qsec), #2
 
> geom = 'point', #3
 
> stat = 'identity', #4
 
> __position = 'identity') + #5__
 
Things in a plot can overlap. This is very common with categorical axes and overlap can be resolved by using a position

Most commonly you:
*  stack (put on top of each other).
*  fill (stack in proportion, up to 1).
*  dodge (put next to each other).
*  jitter (add random noise).
*  leave as is: identity.

For exmaple, the default of geom_bar is stacked: geom_bar(position = "stack")

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(position = 'fill')
```
 
 To dodge the barplots:
  
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge')
```
 
Now, we are going to include facets.
 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge') + # add the barpot
  facet_wrap(c("am")) # put each level of "am" in a different facet
```
 
 That seems much easier to read! One thing that I would like to change, however, is the colors. Let's change the color theme of our plot. You can change the color of the fill using the layer scale_fill_manual()

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge')+ # add the barpot
  facet_wrap(c("am")) + # put each level of "am" in a different facet
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#BBBBBB", # a nice, neuteral grey 
                               "#E69F00")) # a gold caramel color
```
 
Let's add some labels here, where we have to specify position again.
 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl),fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_label(aes(label = ..count..), 
             stat = 'count', 
             position = 'stack') +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#BBBBBB", "#E69F00"))
```
 
Instead of defining the position as a string (e.g. position = "dodge"), you can write it as a full function with arguments (e.g. position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) or tell ggplot where within the boxplot you'd like to posiiton the counts specifically (e.g position = position_stack(vjust=0.5)).
 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..),
            stat = 'count',
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#BBBBBB", "#E69F00"))
```
 
As you can see, the general idea of behind ggplot (starting with just a blank plot and slowly adding more and more layers) also lends itself to a general workflow where we start with a very simple plot and add layers until it looks exactly the way we want.
